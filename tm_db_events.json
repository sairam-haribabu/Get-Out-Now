Disabled and Charter Bus parking can be purchased in advance by calling 206-346-4001 at least 10 business days in advance. Single game parking available in advance through Ticketmaster. Stadium Exhibition Center Garage: 2,000 spaces, located on Royal Brougham Way at First Avenue. Charter bus parking on space available bases. Call 206-254-0811 for more information.

The Mariners discourage fans from parking on the street in the Pioneer Square or International District neighborhoods unless they are also patronizing local merchants there.
